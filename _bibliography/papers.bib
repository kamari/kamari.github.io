abstract = {As we move towards a future of connected and autonomous vehicles, high-speed and low-latency connectivity between vehicles is becoming increasingly important. This paper investigates enabling high data rate mmWave links in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) scenarios using street view images. We find that mmWave V2V links in urban settings suffer from frequent and prolonged blockages, resulting in unreliable connection and high beamforming overhead. Our work proposes mmSV, a system that creates 3D reflection profiles from street view images to assist vehicles in finding mmWave reflections from the environment in real-time. mmSV consists of two key components: material identification which identifies materials from street view images to determine their reflectivity and create 3D reflection map, and environment-driven ray-tracing and beamsearching which finds a high-SNR beam using predicted 3D material maps. Our extensive experimental results on the mmWave testbed show that mmSV can provide highly reliable V2V mmWave connectivity with low beamforming overhead.},

abstract = {This position paper explores the challenges and opportunities for high-quality immersive volumetric video streaming for multiple users over millimeter-wave (mmWave) WLANs. While most of the previous work has focused on single-user streaming, there is a growing need for multi-user immersive applications such as virtual collaboration, classroom education, teleconferencing, etc. While mmWave wireless links can provide multi-gigabit per second data rates, they suffer from blockages and high beamforming overhead. This paper investigates an environment-driven approach to address the challenges. It presents a comprehensive research agenda that includes developing a collaborative 3D scene reconstruction process, material identification, ray tracing, blockage mitigation, and cross-layer multi-user video rate adaptation. Our preliminary results show the feasibility and identify the limitations of existing solutions. Finally, we discuss the open challenges of implementing a practical system based on the proposed research agenda.},
