I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science specializing in Wireless Networking, Sensing, Machine Learning, and Immersive Technologies, advised by Prof. Parth Pathak. My research focuses on developing mmWave networking, RF sensing systems, and multi-user beamforming solutions through the integration of machine learning across diverse modalities. My recent concentration has been on mmWave sensing for AR/VR and UGV devices, enabling applications like environment mapping and 6DoF pose estimation through the integration of neural radiance fields (NeRF), 3DGS and SLAM algorithms.
