Autonomous navigation in vertically challenging environments, where vehicles must traverse complex, unstructured environments characterized by varying terrain properties, obstacles, and dynamic conditions is one of the most challenging frontiers in robotics. These vertical structures introduce discontinuities that break many standard assumptions in ground-robot perception, leading to failures in mapping, obstacle detection, and motion planning. Recent research has explored improved geometric reasoning, elevation mapping, and traversability estimation using vision and depth sensors; however, these modalities remain susceptible to occlusions, poor visibility, and complex lighting conditions. While most existing work focuses on vision and depth sensing, mmWave radars remain largely unexplored for these scenarios. Our goal is to incorporate radar into this line of research and develop perception and navigation algorithms that exploit its robustness to enable reliable operation in vertically complex environments.
